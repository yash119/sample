<h2>1.1 Chloridinine across the locations over the years</h2>
<p>
    
The levels of Chlorodinine have all significantly dropped in recent years. Despite a uniform drop across all locations, Kohsoom alone experiences a spike in it in June 2016 as seen below.

<h2>1.3 Ammonium across the Locatoins over the years</h2>
<p>  The Below visualisations shows:
    <ol>
        <li>
            The levels of Ammonium at Kohsoom has been higher as compared to the other locations throughout the timeframe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Significant spikes occurring throughout 2014-2016 in Kohsoom.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the overall average of Ammonium across locations is 620 ï¿½g/l, the average value at Kohsoom constantly hovers above it (the value shown by the moving line across time).
        </li>
        <li>
            A change-point is being detected around July 2008, where the average Kohsoom concentration of Ammonium jumps from around 2100 to more than 2300.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tansanee in the recent years also shows continual spikes in Ammonium, with a peak attained in November 2014.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
<p>By stepping through the chemical filters, we infer higher baselines at Kohsoom are also found for Orthophosphorus-Phosphorus with peaks in December 2013.

Total Phosphorus as well, follows a very similar uptrend at Kohsoom, with an average twice over the baseline of all other locations.

    <h3>
            2.2 The surge in unique measurements</h3>
        <p>
                On average, there were 43 chemicals measured in a typical year. 2008 and 2009 saw the introduction of over 35 chemicals, leading to the surge in the number of unique chemicals captured. How this affects the analysis is that these unique set of chemicals cannot be compared neither before nor after that specific narrow timeframe. We presume that the hydrology department had an impending need to collect a few samples during those two years, for some research purposes, but later dropped the initiative.

 

                The heatmap illustrates that only a 20% of the total chemicals (21 out of 105) had measurements in all years of the sampling. It also shows which chemicals were measured only as part of the two-year surge.

<h2>2.4 Coverage of the sampling (collecting the samples data)  </h2>
<p>
The plots below show that the coverage of locations are disproportionate, implying the hydrology department has not collected comprehensive data across the preserve. It is also affected by the fact that Achara, Decha and Tansanee started to be measured only from 2009.

4 segments are visible from an analysis of the total number of records. ([Chai & Boonsri], [Kannika & Sakda], [ Kohsoom, Somchair & Busarkhan], [Achara, Decha & Tansanee]).

<h3><u>2.5 sequential sampling approach: </u></h3>  

    <p>Currently, analysis of chemical settlement along river flow is hard to do, as there is no indication of river flow. For a thorough analysis, along the same stream, points upstream and downstream must be measured sequentially. For e.g. if Boonsri was measured in the first week, then it makes sense to compare the same chemical if it has propagated downstream to Chai or Kannika during the second/third week. Given the date of sampling and location, we find the percentage of common routes taken in a river system</p>

    <h3> 3.1 Drop in Oxygen Saturation Levels </h3>
    <p>
            Birds and wildlife feed off water, and Oxygen is essential for any living organism, but Oxygen saturation in water is clearly depleting lower near Kohsoom and Tansanee.

<h3>
        3.3 Release of hot effluents?</h3>
        <p>
                The trend line shows a steeper uptrend at Tansanee as compared to the other locations. There is good reason to believe that the peak of 34C in August 2016 might not have been caused due to natural factors, as the rest of the proximal locations hover around the range of 22-25 C. One plausible explanation could be a factory which uses Tansanee as a water source for their cooling towers, and discharges hot effluents onto the water.

<h3>
    3.4 A relocated dumping site at Somchair/Tansanee
</h3>
<p>
        The recent spikes in Somchair and Tansanee in terms of Lead, Total Nitrogen, etc. provide us a future direction to ponder if these might be new dumping sites that have crept up in recent years. We gain impetus from the below points:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
          <p>Methylosmoline is expected to be higher near Kohsoom, as Kasios had been dumping their industrial waste. However, the uptrend at Somchair is totally unexpected and shows that the Methylosmoline content elsewhere in the preserve might continue to harm the pipits</p>
    </li>
    <li>
            <p>Magnesium uptrend at Somchair (Figure 5) happens along with an uptrend in the stream system of Boonsri-Kannika. These two streams are totally unconnected, discounting a transmission through water borne channels, giving a strong reason to believe some other illicit activity might be happening at Somchair</p>
    </li>

    <h1>
            <u>Proposed changes to sampling strategy </u>
    </h1>
    <h3>
            Regular sampling frequency
    </h3>

    <p>
            The interval between two consecutive samples (not referring to multiple samples on the same day), is shown below. At Boonsri, the department was measuring samples once a month previously, whereas in recent years, we see a surge in the measurements on a weekly/daily basis. In Achara, the trend is quite the opposite of Boonsri. No daily recordings at Tansanee probably illustrates the level of access samplers have in getting there or the importance of Tansanee to the samplers. Tansanee and Somchair need to be measured more frequently than before. Water temperature measured every day at Chai in 2016 probably tells that the samplers have now begun to move towards consistent sampling of chemicals at various locations.
    </p> </br>
<p>
        Redundancy in the chemicals collected can also be understood if the sampling frequencies are aligned across locations, as correlations of different chemical measurements can be checked upon and thereby help narrow down on the chemicals to focus on.
</p>
<p>
    The following visualations shows the recording the frequency of sampling by noting the difference betweeen two consecutive measurements at a particular location(irrespective of the chemical) by using Tableau.
